# üå´Ô∏è AirPure Innovations ‚Äì Air Quality Dashboard & Market Strategy

This project was created for the **Codebasics Air Quality Challenge** and uses real-world AQI, health, and behavioral data to design a region-specific, data-driven product and go-to-market strategy for an air purifier brand.

## üìå Project Overview

India faces one of the highest air pollution levels globally. But pollution isn‚Äôt uniform ‚Äî every city, every region has a unique pollution profile.

This project explores:
- Where air quality is the worst
- Who is most affected
- Which pollutants dominate in each region
- Whether government policies and EVs are helping
- And how to build & market a purifier accordingly
