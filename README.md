# 🌫️ AirPure Innovations – Air Quality Dashboard & Market Strategy

This project was created for the **Codebasics Air Quality Challenge** and uses real-world AQI, health, and behavioral data to design a region-specific, data-driven product and go-to-market strategy for an air purifier brand.

## 📌 Project Overview

India faces one of the highest air pollution levels globally. But pollution isn’t uniform — every city, every region has a unique pollution profile.

This project explores:
- Where air quality is the worst
- Who is most affected
- Which pollutants dominate in each region
- Whether government policies and EVs are helping
- And how to build & market a purifier accordingly

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Delhi, Byrnihat, Gurugram**: Highest AQI zones — priority markets  
- **South India**: PM10 & SO2 dominant → Chemical scrubbers needed  
- **Health Impact**: Children & working adults most affected  
- **Behavioral Trends**: Purifier searches spike 600% during AQI 300+  
- **ROI**: A ₹25K purifier can save ₹50K in asthma treatment costs  
- **Competitor Gaps**: No regional customization, smart syncing, or health dashboards  
- **EV ≠ Solution**: High EV adoption hasn’t reduced AQI in top cities
